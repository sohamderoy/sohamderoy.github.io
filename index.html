		<h1>Hi there! I am Soham and thank you for paying a visit</h1>
		<p align = "justify"> Currently I am persuing my Masters from IIT Kanpur. Though my degrees are in Chemical
			Engineering and Material Science, I love coding. In a dream to become a self taught coder
			I am currently trying to be proficient in programming languages like Python by doing online 
			courses. I've also developed an interest in web development recently and thus I have decided 
			to apply all the stuff that I learn in order to create my own web page. I hope this description 
			section changes regularly as I keep on learning more sills. As they say <strong>Rome wasn't build in a day</strong>.
